# Documentation

This secton contains general IT Support documentation, reference material, and process notes used to support troubleshooting and systems administration tasks.

The content in this folder is designed to reflect how IT teams document procedures, workflows, and recurring tasks outside of individual support tickets or labs.

## Contents

- Troubleshooting workflows and checklists
- Incident documentation templates
- Account management procedures
- Access control and security notes
- Reference material used during supports tasks

As this portfolio grows, additional documentation will be added to support and complement the hands-on labs.
